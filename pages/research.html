            Visualization is an important area of research that allows viewers to apply their visual
            perception to identify characteristics in data represented as an image. Traditionally,
            visualization tools are created for desktop platforms but this can introduce accessibility,
            portability or distribution issues. Recently, it was proposed that visualization tools be
            deployed as web applications that can be accessed from web browsers. There are many
            issues when building a web based visualization such as which techniques to use for drawing
            the visualizations, how to provide interactivity and what strategies to use for data
            management. In order to develop a visualization tool, one can either use existing libraries
            or build the tools from scratch. We selected, then extended, an existing library. We also
            explored two user interface libraries to allow a user to control the visualization. Finally,
            we evaluated two different approaches for managing data. We applied these techniques to
            develop visualization tools for the National Collaborative for Bio-Preparedness (NCBP)
            project and the Missing Meals of North Carolina (MMNC) project. Our visualizations
            run in any modern browser. We received positive feedback from domain experts in both
            the projects, suggesting our tools provide effective visualizations.
